# ImClass Memory Viewer

## perception.cx Support
- **WebSocket-based memory access** via Perception AngelScript bridge for safe remote memory operations
- **Module enumeration** through PEB walking with cached module list
- **String types**: UTF8, UTF16, UTF32 with configurable lengths
- **Double-precision vectors**: Vector2d, Vector3d, Vector4d
- **Offset locking system**: Lock variables to absolute offsets to prevent shifting when modifying structure above them
- **Console window**: Real-time logging with copy-to-clipboard support
- **Module list viewer**: Browse all loaded modules with base addresses and sizes

## Tips

Math operations work inside the address bar (ex. "**ntdll.dll + 0x4000**" or "**ntdll.dll + 4100 - 0x50 - 50**" give the same resulting address)

All numbers passed into the address bar are assumed to be hexadecimal (0x1000 == 1000 when searching).

Adding a library name to the address bar will result in its base address being used in math operations involving it.

To view an export, put the library name appended by an exclamation mark and the export name into the address bar (ex. **kernel32.dll!ReadProcessMemory** or **kernel32.dll!WriteProcessMemory**)

Entering an invalid operation into the address bar will just result in a zeroed out output currently.

Right-click any named variable and select "Lock Offset" to prevent it from moving when you modify the structure above it.
